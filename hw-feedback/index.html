    <p>None</p>

    <h2>What was difficult</h2>

    <p>None</p>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>

    <p>
      Designing on paper is a great way to learn the usability and Heuristics of
      our designs. I have learned the flaws on my initial designs and realized I
      need to put more time on the design before going to make the actual
      product.
