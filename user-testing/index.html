        <h2>Language Translation Button</h2>
        <p>
          <span> Goal:</span> My Goal was to test the usability and
          effectiveness of the language-translation feature in the chat app by
          having the user translate a message into a language they understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span> Rationale:</span> This task helps me assess how well users can
          navigate and use the language translation button and whether they can
          translate messages into the correct language without confusion.
        </p>

        <h2>Customize Language setting</h2>
        <p>
          <span> Goal:</span> my goal was to test how well a user can use the
          chat setting to customize the language settings. i.e., I want to
          understand how well users can use the chat setting to select and save
          a preferred language for translation in the chat app.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span> Rationale:</span> This task helps me to assess the usability of
          the language settings feature and how well users can customize their
          language preferences to suit their needs.

        <h2>Long-press Translation</h2>
        <p>
          <span> Goal:</span> my goal was to test the effectiveness and
          usability of the long-press method for translation by having users
          translate a message using long-press and select translate from the
          menu that follows the long press.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span> Rationale:</span> This task helps me to assess how well users
          can navigate and use the long-press method for translation and whether
          they can successfully translate the message into the language of their
          choice

        <h2>Observation, Insight, and Plans for Change</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>1. Observation</h3>
        <h4>User-1 Language Translation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The user needed help finding the language translation button on the
            paper prototype because it needed to be clearly labeled. The user
            required some guidance to locate the button and use the feature to
            translate the message.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user Suggested adding a clear Label or icon to the language
            translation button would make it easier to locate and use on the
            paper prototype.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user also commented that the list of languages to choose from
            after selecting the language translation button needed to be shorter
            and more organized, making it easier to select the language.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User-2 Customize language setting</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The user takes time to find the chat setting at the top of the
            screen. Once the user identified the setting icon, they could
            complete most of the tasks with little to no help.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user suggested that adding a clear label, Making the setting
            icon bigger, or separating the icon from other interfaces would make
            locating and using the paper prototype easier.
          </li>
          <li>
            The User also added that the process for setting a preferred
            language could have been more intuitive for first-time users.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User-3 Long-press Translation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This user needed help figuring out where to start and asked for
            guidance on where to start the translation process. When the user
            was told to long press, they expressed they had that in mind but
            were unsure.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user suggested a Help section. They said a written help guide
            might be useful, especially when users are stuck. They can look up
            the help section and learn how to proceed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Insight</h3>
        <p>From my observation, I gained the following insights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clear labeling and visual cues are critical for helping users locate
            and use the language translation button, language settings feature,
            and long-press translation option on the paper prototype.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users may need help navigating long lists of languages and may
            require additional organization or search functionality to find the
            languages easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although it may seem challenging to achieve the final product, I
            want to mention users' concerns about translation accuracy. The
            users raise an issue of translation accuracy before responding in
            another language.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Plans for Change</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add clear labels or icons to the language translation button and
            language settings button option to improve their learnability and
            pleasant user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Separate the language settings feature from other interface elements
            and provide more guidance to help users customize their language
            preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide additional organization or search functionality to help
            users navigate long lists of languages when translating a message.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conduct further user testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the
            changes I will make to improve the usability of my language
            translation features.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Finally, the user testing with a paper prototype gave me valuable
          insight into the usability of my chat app's language translation
          feature. I plan to use this insight to make appropriate adjustments to
          the paper prototype to create a better user experience for users who
          may have difficulties understanding how to interact with the language
          translation feature.
